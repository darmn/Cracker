Collect `UncaughtException` when your android app crash.

__PAUSE DEVELOPMENT!!!__

Conside that implement this function need to wait the __[Xposed](https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed "Xposed")__ updates to support __[ART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Runtime "ART")__ so we pause development.

## How to use the source code?

Just __import__ the `Cracker` folder with your __IntelliJ IDEA__.
